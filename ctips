<<<When picking extracurriculrs, ask yourself these 6 questions:

1. Is it original?

2. Does it highlight your academic passion?

3. Is it selective?

4. Will it lead to any awards or publications?

5. Does it allow you to demonstrate leadership?

6. Does it benefit your community?

If the answer is "yes" to most of these, then it is probably a great activity to pursue. If the answer is "no" to most, try looking into other activities that might be more beneficial in the long run!

<<<When choosing extracurriculars, classes, and essay topics, try to connect all of them with a common theme. 

For example, say I'm interested in science. My EC's could be internships in research labs, STEM olympiads, etc. My classes could be more science oritented, such as computer science, biology, chemistry, and physics. My essays could be about why I love science or specific experiences I had in that field. 

This shows colleges that you have a "spike." A specific area of interest that you can pursue later in life and perform much better in. Colleges would rather have many kids with different spikes than a ton of well rounded students. Well rounded students have nothing special about them. Ivy leagues and top colleges, they want special people. So develop a spike and connect all parts of your application to it. 

<<<Throughout your high school career, show improvement.

Every year you want to show improvement. Whether it is taking one more AP than last year or making varsity as opposed to JV, show you are leveling up and will continue to level up. Never do less than you did the year before. 

<<<When writing essays, write in stories.

Humans evolved to speak in stories. Concrete writing is always more memorable than abstract. Your essays should tell a story so the admissions officer can remember that story and fight for you to get in. 

Don't be afraid to be emotive. You want your reader to feel something. 

<<<If you had 10 seconds to tell a Yale admissions officer about yourself in an elevator, what would be the three things you would want them to know?

Pick those three things and pusue them greatly. Then make them evident in your application. 

<<<Instead of spending so much time participating in other clubs, drop two and found your own. 

Founding your own club helps admissions officers see that you take leadership and create things you think are important. You don't just follow along other clubs, you create your own. 

<<<Make sure some of your application is unique to only you. 

Having unique things in your application can really help you stand out as an applicant. Some unique activities others don't have on their applications might be founding unique clubs, building unique websites, or winning selective awards.

Thousands of kids participate in key club, are student council president, and play soccer. But how many students have built a website that people can subscribe to to get daily college tips?

<<<Tailor your application to the specific college your applying to. 

Each college has its own "niche," and students should use that to their advantage when applying. For example, Yale has a great liberal arts program and music department. If you were applying to Yale, show how you would take advantage of the various programs they have to offer. This also shows you are interested in their specific programs, increasing your chance of getting in. 

<<<Try and show your personaluty throughout the application. 

If you feel humour is a strength of yours, show it off with a joke in the essays. Let the admissions officers see YOU.

10<<<If you are offered an interview, take it.

Interviews help admissions officers talk with you and get a real sense of who you are. Turning down an interview could be interpreted as a lack of interest in the institution. 


<<<If you have a college interview, turn the interview questions into a conversation. 


People like talking. People convince themselves of things as they talk. If you continuously ask the interviewer questions and make the process conversational, I can gaurentee the person will love you. Ask them about their experience at the school, ask them what they think was their favorite class, or even what clubs they participated in. 


<<<Although grades aren't as important as EC's and essays, prioritize an SAT score above 1500.

SAT scores have a disproportionate impact on your application. They are also, luckily, a test where studying can really help bring up those scores. The SAT has basically the same questions in different contexts or numbers everytime. So if you can master every type of question, those will be repeated on the real test. 

<<<Try to start EC's early and continue them throughout the four years.

A genuine time commitment in your application can help your activites rise above those of the "standard strong" applicants. Participating in certain events for all four years shows dedication to that event. It also shows that you arent just doing these things for college your college application. 


<<<Colleges evaluate EC's mainly off these four things:

1. Time commitment

2. Amount of teamwork involved

3. Frequency of participation 

4. Volume of participation

Try to go above and beyond on all four parts and really make them evident in your application. 

<<<If trying to get recruited for a sport, write to the college coaches prior to junior/senior year. 

If wanting to promote a coaches interest in you, write them a letter early listing athletic achievements and academic credentials. This could help spike a coaches interest in you and raise your chances of recruitment.

<<<Develop a strategy behind selecting recommenders for letters of rec.

1. Give ample time to those whom you ask to write.

2. Limit additional recs to the most appropriate few. 

3. Try to submit all the letters as close to the application deadline as possible.

<<<Make your summers count.

Do something unique, special, and personal to you. This will help you stand out and not be one of many. Get a job, start a startup, learn code. Anything that is relevant to your desires. 

<<<Early decision/action can improve chances of getting admitted. 

Early decision shows that you are interested in the college enough to put it as your "first choice." Colleges want students who want them so this can really increase your chances. 

<<<Continuity in all that you do is essential. 

FLip flopping between all over the place is unproductive. It can even be unattractive to colleges if you show a lack of passion and personalization. 

20<<<Take many AP's, but if they start interfering with time you could spend developing something unique and becoming "world class," cut back on a few!

Two AP's is a lot more than one. Five is a lot more than four. But ten is not a lot more than nine. If you have many AP's taking one more doesn't do that much for your application. If you are a science kid and need more time for research and awards, drop taking AP lang. It won't make a difference. 

<<<Stay focused senior year. 

A sub par semester can be devastating, while a strong first term can boost rank. It is also expected from highly selective colleges. You don't want to have anything going against you in the application process. Stay focused. 

<<<Do not take the SAT more than three times.

Scores are unlikely to improve after two attempts. And admissions offices receive all scores so they might view students with 3+ attempts as too test-focused.

<<<Consider applying to these programs that top colleges LOVE:

Math and Science Olympiad programs (U.S and international teams)

Research Science Institute

Telluride Association Summer Program (TASP)

Simons Summer Research Program

Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science (MITES)

Research in Science and Engineering Program (RISE)

Bank of America Student Leaders Program

Attending these programs really increase chances of admissions.

<<<In your essays don't mention acheivements that can be found elsewhere in your application. 

Awards and other acheivements already on your applicaton have no place in your essays. This makes the admissions officer think you are self-centered and bragging. They already know what you put down, no need to flaunt it. 

<<<Make great connections with advisors.

Coaches,teachers, guidance counselors, research mentors, etc. These people know you well and could write a stellar recommendation. 

<<<In every club you do, try and get a leadership position.

Being a member in a club doesn't mean much to top admissions officers, but being a leader does. Try and take leadership in everything you do.

<<<Make sure there is nothing bad on social media. 

Colleges do look at social media accounts and if there is inappropriate stuff you are likely to not get in. 

<<<Do not wait till the deadline to submit your application.

Colleges get a ton of applications on the deadline and it's very stressful for them and can be detrimental to your chance of getting in. Apply as early as possible. 

<<<Optional isn't always optional.

You have to take advantage of whatever can give you an edge against other students applying to college. When something relatively important is listed as optional, I'd suggest sending it in anyways.

30<<<When visiting schools, make sure you get an official tour and the school is aware you visited.

This shows the school you are interested in them enough to visit their campus and meet with someone. Also, make sure to meet with an advisor or interviewer at the school!

<<< Pick extracurriculars and activities that truly make you happy.

When picking activities, the best way to excel in them is if you actually like them. Your love will show through when writing about them and participating in them. It is genuine and will make the whole process easier. 

<<<Look through decision threads on sites such as College Confidential.

See the stats of other students admissions. This will allow you to understand better what you have to do to get in. Higher test scores? Better extracurriculars?

<<<Do not procrasinate on the application.

This will make everything 10x more stressful and significantly lower your chances of getting in. Pressure and stress don't make a good application. Start early, take a deep breath, work through and improve things.

<<<Research the school you are interested in first.

When applying, try to incorporate specific information about the certain school you are applying to to show them you care enough to do research. 

<<<Your essays need to reflect your voice.

Let colleges see who you are. You want them to like you, to feel like they know you. Speak in your voice. 

<<<Emphasize throughout your application what makes you different.

Why you? What makes you different from her? Grades don't make anyone different. Being well-rounded doesn't make you different. Show what makes you different. 

<<<Set high goals for yourself.

If you set high expectations, a bit higher than you think you can reach, you will either make it, or fall right below. If you aim for Harvard and fall short, then you get into Duke. If you aim for Duke then fall short, you get into University of Florida. 

<<<Have tangible evidence of your passion.

Don't just say you are passionate about computer science. Show it! Create a website, an IOS game, a useful application. Give the admissions officers something to look at and evidence of your passion and dedication.

40<<<Demonstrate intellectual curiosity.

Show you aren't just getting good grades for external factors such as college admissions. Show you are intrinsically motivated and truly care and are curious about what you are learning.

<<< This one is just a reminder but be honest. 

There are many stories of students who lied in their application or interview and were caught and faced serious consequences. The risk is not worth it. Neither is the guilt you will feel later. Do not lie. 

<<<Explain the "why" on everything you write.

Compare these two pieces:

I love writing poetry. Ever since I was 8 I have loved writing poetry.

I love writing poetry. Poetry allows me to express my feelings on paper and look back at verses later with a deeper understanding of how I was feeling in the moment. Being able to look back in time helps me to understand myself better and, therfore, improve myself.

<<<Be a good person.

Over and over again colleges deny acceptance to exceptionally qualified candidates because they sound like jerks, are arrogant, or just have a bad personality. Colleges don't want people like this on their campus. Admissions officers definitely aren't finding reasons to like them and the college students won't either. This student will not get in because they do not mesh well with the campus. 

<<<Learn the score averages of universities you are applying to.

If you have an ACT score of 30 and the average for Yale is a 34, you may want to improve your score. Research these averages and make sure you fall into or above them (preferablly above).

<<<Make sure you have activities that demonstrate teamwork.

Being able to cooperate with others and form a team/community is very impressive. Try and demonstrate you work well with teams.

<<<Start forming relationships with teachers.

You need to have two+ recommendations from teachers, so start forming friendships and relationships with them early. They are an important part of your college application. 

<<<Demonstrate initiative and being a self-starter.

Whether its starting your own club, building a website, or creating a competition, show you have initiative. You want to start and create things. You don't want to follow other people and wait around for everyone else. 

<<<When considering where to apply, narrow down your list before you apply to too many schools.

Applying to over 15 schools is a very stressful process. Try to keep it under 15 so you don't lose track of all the deadlines and supplemental essays. 


<<<Create a spreadsheet for colleges.

Include relevant information such as deadlines, acceptance rate, the decision, how likely you would want to go there, etc. This will keep you more organized and hopefully less stressed out during the process. 


50<<<Quality over quantity for extracurriculars.

Colleges like to see higher-impact and meaningful ec's over many irrelevant, common ones. Aim to improve your extracurriculars instead of adding more on.
