Ideas for new project:

1. 

2. Motivation/accountability tool for school or cs

3. AP groups for studying (peer tutoring) online!
- problem is ap classes dont all go at the same pace

4. Site like brainly where you can propose start up ideas and see what people think of them. Earn points when you answer and give advice, use points to post ideas to get advice.

5. Website template for personal use. People pay $5 to input information into a template. 

6. Almost like a pinterest for fashion. People post pictures of patterns and ideas, styles, cool different sewing techniques, etc.

7. 

8. Terminal practice couse. Like in freecodecamp.org , you type something in (the fake terminal) and something will happen or it wont.

9. Site where you answer some questions and the best books personalized to what you would like show up. (with ratings and summaries included). You could also do the same with music, etc.
